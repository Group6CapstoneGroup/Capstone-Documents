# Experience/Overview

Overall, the project was fun, and it was cool to develop something from the ground up. Our group however did become very small quickly through the project so it would have been nice to have others to collaborate with more.

Blazor/Flask was a new space I was able to learn, and I learned a lot from Paige on the ML/AI side as well with her putting together the model.

I think overall this was a good lesson and the big takeaway was to consistently be keeping up with documentation. It can be hard to go back and catch up on documentation to make sure you are capturing all the gotchas and providing a more accurate and detailed explanation in the development process.
