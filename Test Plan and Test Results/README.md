# Tune Tip Testing Guide

## Unit Testing

We utilize unit tests in both our [recommendation-service](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/recommendation-service) and [music-service](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/music-service). We have created Postman collections and enviornments to run these efficiently and quickly. If you do not have Postman installed on your machine, please refer to this download [link]( https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
