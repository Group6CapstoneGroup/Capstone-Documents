# Tune Tip Testing Instructions

## Unit/Integration Testing

We utilize unit tests in both our [recommendation-service](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/recommendation-service) and [music-service](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/music-service). We have created Postman collections and enviornments to run these efficiently and quickly. If you do not have Postman installed on your machine, please refer to this download [link]( https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## UI Testing

For UI testing we are utilizing Selenium and the test project is located within the music-ui repository under the `TuneTipUITests.UITests` project. To run the UI tests is very simple navigate up to the menu bar and hit Debug and when the drop down appears select Start Without Debugging. Once the Tune Tip UI pulls up in a seperate window you can navigate to the test explorer. You should see TuneTipUITests, right click on it and select Run.

Here's a [snip](test-explorer-tests-snip.PNG) of how the test explorer will look and all passing UI tests for all live pages on Tune Tip UI.
