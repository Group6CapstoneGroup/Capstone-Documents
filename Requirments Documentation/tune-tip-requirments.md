# Tune Tip Requirments

## Common Acroynyms Used Through Documentation

- **UI:** User interface
- **ML:** Machine learning
- **AI:** Artifical intellegence

## Introduction

The purpose of the requirements documentation is to provide the reader with understanding of the layout of our solution Tune Tip. We are currently storing all our documentation in GitHub and will refer to any detailed documentation needed to our Capstone-Documentation repository within our organization we set up. The detailed scope of this product can be found at this [link](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/Capstone-Documents/tree/main/Project%20Plan%20and%20Umbrella%20Activities/Scope%20Statement%20Assignment). You can also find a list of the tools we utilized to build/develop our product here at this [link](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/Capstone-Documents/tree/main/Project%20Plan%20and%20Umbrella%20Activities/Tools%20%26%20Standards). We are currently using utilizing Markdown to write up most of our documentation. The reason being is itâ€™s simple, proficent at formatting, and makes referencing other documentation in our organization easy.

## General Description

The general description and idea of Tune Tip came about from solving a common problem Paige and I had. We both live a somewhat active lifestyle and wanted to build a music recommendation application that was specific to the listener's own interests. We already were aware that other streaming platforms like Apple Music, Prime Music, Spotify provide a music recommendation service. What makes Tune Tip unique is the possibilities and customization of it. The idea would be to have Tune Tip be able to integrate with all major streaming platforms. This way our dataset and findings won't just be from customers of one music streaming platform like our competitors. For example, Apple only receives feedback and findings on their recommendations based on their Apple Music users. We would have users from a variety of streaming platforms. This would allow us to build more complex recommendation models. We could also customize the recommendation models based on what attribute we wanted the model to make a prediction model. For instance, if I wanted to listen to songs at a specific tempo, I could instruct the model to find other songs that are like songs on my playlist that have a specific tempo I am wanting. For the sake and time/resources of this project we are currently utilizing a recommendation finder to recommend songs based on song title and artist only. The possibilities for a solution like Tune Tip are endless.

With ML/AI advancing in the technical world we could provide our potential customers with customized recommendations and partner with some of the leading music streaming providers. The goal for Tune Tip is to be as automated as possible from end to end. Meaning we can automate extracting the data from the streaming platform to get the user's playlists. We are then able to make song recommendations based on what the user is looking for, again for the sake of this project we are utilizing song title and artist. Once the user is satisfied and has found songs to freshen up their playlist, we can then sync the data and add the new tracks to the user's streaming account with no manual entry on the user's part. For the sake of this product, we have already manually input a list of dummy music data to play with to show how the product works.
