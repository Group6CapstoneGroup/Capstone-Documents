# Tune Tip Requirments

## Common Acroynyms Used Through Documentation

- **UI:** User interface
- **ML:** Machine learning
- **AI:** Artifical intellegence
- **CORS:** Cross Origin Resource Sharing

## Introduction

The purpose of the requirements documentation is to provide the reader with understanding of the layout of our solution Tune Tip. We are currently storing all our documentation in GitHub and will refer to any detailed documentation needed to our Capstone-Documentation repository within our organization we set up. The detailed scope of this product can be found at this [link](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/Capstone-Documents/tree/main/Project%20Plan%20and%20Umbrella%20Activities/Scope%20Statement%20Assignment). You can also find a list of the tools we utilized to build/develop our product here at this [link](https://github.com/Group6CapstoneGroup/Capstone-Documents/tree/main/Project%20Plan%20and%20Umbrella%20Activities/Tools%20%26%20Standards). We are currently using utilizing Markdown to write up most of our documentation. The reason being is itâ€™s simple, proficent at formatting, and makes referencing other documentation in our organization easy.

## General Description

The general description and idea of Tune Tip came about from solving a common problem Paige and I had. We both live a somewhat active lifestyle and wanted to build a music recommendation application that was specific to the listener's own interests. We already were aware that other streaming platforms like Apple Music, Prime Music, Spotify provide a music recommendation service. What makes Tune Tip unique is the possibilities and customization of it. The idea would be to have Tune Tip be able to integrate with all major streaming platforms. This way our dataset and findings won't just be from customers of one music streaming platform like our competitors. For example, Apple only receives feedback and findings on their recommendations based on their Apple Music users. We would have users from a variety of streaming platforms. This would allow us to build more complex recommendation models. We could also customize the recommendation models based on what attribute we wanted the model to make a prediction model. For instance, if I wanted to listen to songs at a specific tempo, I could instruct the model to find other songs that are like songs on my playlist that have a specific tempo I am wanting. For the sake and time/resources of this project we are currently utilizing a recommendation finder to recommend songs based on song title and artist only. The possibilities for a solution like Tune Tip are endless.

With ML/AI advancing in the technical world we could provide our potential customers with customized recommendations and partner with some of the leading music streaming providers. The goal for Tune Tip is to be as automated as possible from end to end. Meaning we can automate extracting the data from the streaming platform to get the user's playlists. We are then able to make song recommendations based on what the user is looking for, again for the sake of this project we are utilizing song title and artist. Once the user is satisfied and has found songs to freshen up their playlist, we can then sync the data and add the new tracks to the user's streaming account with no manual entry on the user's part. For the sake of this product, we have already manually input a list of dummy music data to play with to show how the product works.

## Specific Requirments

### UI

- **1.0.0:** Create a user friendly homepage that is easy to navigate and explains what the application is set to do.
  - **1.0.1:** The homepage will display a navigation bar with the app name toggled to the left and three clickable links toggled to the right.
  - **1.0.2:** The first link will be labeled Home. If clicked the user will be redirected to the homepage of the application.
  - **1.0.3:** The second link will be labeled About. If clicked the user will be redirected to the about section of the application. This form displays the about content of Tune Tip.
  - **1.0.4:** The third link will be labeled Support. If clicked the user will be redirected to the support section of the application. This form displays user instructions and a support contact.

- **1.1.0:** Because we offer a platform that ideally integrates will multiple streaming services, provide a way to log into the program and selecting the streaming platform the user currently utilizes.

- **1.2.0:** Provide a way to secure details until user is successfully logged into application. Data should not be visible to just anyone who logs into the application.
  - **1.2.1** For this application and playing with dummy data we will set dummy login credentials that are needed to go utilize application features.

- **1.3.0:** Once user has successfully been authenticated please navigate to the account page so the user can see their music data extracted.

- **1.4.0:** Populate a selectable data grid with music information, this way the user can individually check each row item they would like to feed to the recommendation model.

- **1.5.0:** On the account screen add a button to feed selected music to recommendation model.
  - **1.5.1:** If pressed the UI should navigate to the recommendation page of the UI.

- **1.6.0:** On the account screen add a sync button to sync music data to the user's streaming account.
  - **1.6.1:** If pressed the UI should display a loader screen to the user to indicate the syncing is happening and the user should not be able to access any other functionality until syncing is done.
  
- **1.7.0:** The recommendation screen will display the music data the user has selected to feed to the recommendation model.
  - **1.7.1:** The data will be displayed in a non selectable datagrid.

- **1.8.0:** Below the data grid there will be 3 buttons.
  - **1.8.1:** The first button will be labeled add songs. If clicked the user redirected to the account page, this is where they can add more songs to feed to recommendation model.
  - **1.8.2:** The second is a button labeled delete list. If the clicked the music selection list will be cleared out. The user will then be redirected to the account page where they can select a new list of music to send to recommendation model.
  - **1.8.3:** The third is a button submit. If the clicked the UI will populate a spinner to indicate to the user the song data is being fed to the recommendation model. Once completed and we get recommendations back the loading indicator will stop and recommendations will be displayed.

- **2.0.0:** The user has the ability to select the specified rows they would like to add to their music playlist.
- **2.1.0:** Under the data grid with the listed recommendations there will be a button labeled Add Songs.
  - **2.1.1:** If clicked the user will be redirected back to the account page where they will see their newly updated playlist.

### Music Service

- **1.0.0:** The music-service will have two seperate models it will work with the first being music model and the second being selected song model.
  - **1.0.1:** Both these models have the same attributes: recordId, recordNumber, track, artist, playlist, album.
  - **1.0.2:** music model will be the original data from the user that we save and keep as a refernce when extracting and importing data to streaming the user's streaming service. This information will be stored in it's own table in the database.
  - **1.0.3:** selected song model will be the data the user interacts with our recommendation model with. This information will be stored in it's own table in the database.
- **1.1.0:** Music service will contain a controller for music model. This controller is what the UI will ping when it make's request for information from music serivce (CORS).
  - **1.1.1:** The controller will contain a number of requests for GET, POST and DELETE functionality.
  - **1.1.2:** The first method in music controller will be GetMusic(). This method will return a list of music it gets back from music service.
  - **1.1.3:** The second method in music controller will be GetTrack(). This method will return a single music item with the corresponding record number the user entered in.
